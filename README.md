## Circuit Analysis

The task for this coursework was to write a C program that will analyse general electrical circuits connected in the common cascade connection as set by [EE20084] (http://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2018-2019/ee/EE20084.html): *Structured Programming*. Series and shunt resistances of any value can be connected in any order between the source and load of the circuit.
